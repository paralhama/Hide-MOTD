This plugin displays a hidden MOTD with a custom link, making it a great plugin for playing radio stations, welcome sounds.

To set a url on hidden MOTD put ```hidden_motd_url "URL HERE"``` in server.cfg

Example: ```hidden_motd_url "https://google.com"```

Don't put url wihout ```http://``` or ```https://``` on ```hidden_motd_url```

MOTD will not load any links without these protocols
